      # Scoreboard

      The scoreboard is visible at [#{scoreboard_path}](#{scoreboard_path}).
      The columns are:

      * SLA: the percentage of availability checks we've made that have succeeded.
      * Flags: the number of flags that haven't been made available for capture.
        This column has two colors; the dark crimson portion is ones that are
        available to capture, and the pink band represents queued flags.
      * Total: SLA Ã— Flags.

      # Scoring

      Hack services, retrieve tokens. Redeem tokens for flags.

      Token redemption is done via a signed HTTPS POST request to
      [#{redemption_path}](#{redemption_path}).
